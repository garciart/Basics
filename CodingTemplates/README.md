# The Basics - My Coding Templates

Have you ever spent a couple of months on a project, coding in one language, and then having to switch to another language quickly...sometimes too quickly? Even though I know several languages well, switching back and forth between them can lead to stupid mistakes. I sometimes have "back in the saddle" issues, and I've felt pretty dumb spending half a day debugging a Python program before I realized I wrote the erroneous code in Java.

Web sites like [Rosetta Code](http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) are great and have a lot of functionality, but sometimes I'm just looking for a quick memory jog. To that end, here's several templates, written in C, Java, Python, and more, with sample code that implement those parts of the respective APIs that I use most.
