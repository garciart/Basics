# The Coder's Companion - My System Security Plans

If you ever get a chance to intern at NASA, especially as a developer, do it! Working with the best and brightest is a great experience and you will learn a lot. However, you will also learn about the struggle of balancing Dev-Sec-Ops. For example, in order to do localhost development, you had to have a security plan. For many developers, this was an example of government "red tape", but, truthfully, it is a sound practice.

Therefore, I decided to create a set of boilerplate system security plans I could pull off the shelf and modify as needed. The gold standard for government work is the [NIST SP 800-18 Rev. 1, Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-18/rev-1/final), and Appendix A contains a sample information system security plan template.  For me, the most important part is paragraph 13, Minimum Security Controls, where you explain the steps you will take to secure your system, mapping them to the controls in [NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-4/final). I found the easiest way to accomplish this was to use [the benchmarks published by the Center for Internet Security](https://www.cisecurity.org/) and then map them to [the NIST 800-53 controls.](https://www.cisecurity.org/white-papers/cis-controls-v7-1-mapping-to-nist-csf/).
