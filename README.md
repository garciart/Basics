# The Basics

![Dilbert, by Scott Adams](README/dt140426.gif)

## Background

Some programmers can recite a whole API by heart, but I'm not one of those guys. There probably was a time that I could tell you exactly where to look for a piece of code in the C Primer Plus or Peter Norton's Assembly Language Book for the IBM PC. However, due to school, work, and life in general, I, paraphrasing Albus Dumbledore, sometimes find that I have too much junk crammed into my brain housing group to remember what I did five minutes ago. So, this is my repository of basic things to remember and implement: my software developer pensieve.
