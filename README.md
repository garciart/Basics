# The Basics
<h2>This is my repository of basic stuff I should remember as a software engineer.</h2>
<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>First, if you ever get a chance to intern at NASA, especially as a developer, do it! Working with the best and brightest is a great experience and you will learn a lot.</p>
<p>However, you will also learn about "red tape". </p>
<h3>Security:</h3>
<p>Before laying down any code, you should have a security plan, even for localhost development. The gold standard for government work is the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-18/rev-1/final" title="NIST SP 800-18">NIST SP 800-18 Rev. 1, Guide for Developing Security Plans for Federal Information Systems</a>, and Appendix A contains a sample information system security plan template you can use.  For me, the most important part is paragraph 13, Minimum Security Controls, where you explain the steps you will take to secure your system, mapping them to the controls in <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-4/final" title="NIST SP 800-53">NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4, Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations</a>. I found the easiest way to accomplish this was to use the benchmarks published by the <a href=" https://www.cisecurity.org/" title="Center for Internet Security">Center for Internet Security</a> and map them to the NIST 800-53 controls.</p>
<h3>Code:</h3>
<p>Have you ever spent a couple of months on a project, coding in one language, and then having to switch to another language quickly...sometimes too quickly? Even though I know several languages well, switching back and forth between them can lead to stupid mistakes. I sometimes have "back in the saddle" issues, and I've felt pretty dumb spending half a day debugging a Python program before I realized I wrote some of the code in Java.</p>
<p>To that end, here's several programs, written in C, Java, Python, and more, that all do the same thing: implement their versions of the common reserved keywords, as well as implement other common tasks and features, such as reading command-line arguments or unit testing.</p>
