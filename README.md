# The Basics
<h2>A project focused on implementing common keywords from different languages.</h2>
<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>Have you ever spent a couple of months on a project, coding in one language, and then having to switch to another language quickly...sometimes too quickly? Even though I know several languages well, switching back and forth between them can lead to stupid mistakes. I sometimes have "back in the saddle" issues, and I've felt pretty dumb spending half a day debugging a Python program before I realized I wrote some of the code in Java.</p>
<p>To that end, here's several programs, written in C, Java, Python, and more, that all do the same thing: implement their versions of the common reserved keywords, as well as implement other common tasks and features, such as reading command-line arguments or unit testing.</p>
