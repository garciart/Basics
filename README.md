# The Basics
<h2>A project focused on implementing all 32 reserved keywords from C in various languages.</h2>
<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>Have you ever spent a couple of months on a project, coding in one language, and then having to switch to another language quickly...sometimes too quickly? Even though I know several languages well, switching back and forth between them can lead to stupid mistakes. I sometimes have "back in the saddle" issues, and I've felt pretty dumb spending half a day debugging a Python program before I realized I wrote some of the code in Java.</p>
<p>To that end, here's several programs, written in C, Java, Python, and more, that all do the same thing: implement their versions of the reserved keywords from Kernighan and Ritchie's great book, as well as implement common tasks and features, such as reading command-line arguments or unit testing.</p>
<h3>The Original 32 Keywords:</h3>
<table>
<tr><td>auto</td><td>double</td><td>int</td><td>struct</td></tr>
<tr><td>break</td><td>else</td><td>long</td><td>switch</td></tr>
<tr><td>case</td><td>enum</td><td>register</td><td>typedef</td></tr>
<tr><td>char</td><td>extern</td><td>return</td><td>union</td></tr>
<tr><td>continue</td><td>for</td><td>signed</td><td>void</td></tr>
<tr><td>do</td><td>if</td><td>static</td><td>while</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td>goto</td><td>sizeof</td><td>volatile</td></tr>
<tr><td>const</td><td>float</td><td>short</td><td>unsigned</td></tr>
</table>
