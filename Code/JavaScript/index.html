    <p>Hello friend? That's lame. Maybe I should give you a name. But that's a slippery slope, you're only in my head,
        we have to remember that.</p>
    <p>Shit, this actually happened, I'm talking to an imaginary person.</p>
    <p>What I'm about to tell you is top secret. A conspiracy bigger than all of us.</p>
    <p>There's a powerful group of people out there that are secretly running the world.</p>
    <p>I'm talking about the guys no one knows about, the ones that are invisible. The top 1% of the top 1%, the guys
        that play God without permission.</p>
    <p>And now I think they're following me...</p>
